------------------------------------

* Based on CSS-Tricks article
[http://codepen.io/noahblon/post/coloring-svgs-in-css-background-images]

* Original base color for RadioTimes logo was black, changed to red by adding fill="red" into SVG.

* Correct hue/saturation etc. values will specify the output color (fill to be removed from SVG)
